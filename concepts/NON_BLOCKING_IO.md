# Non-blocking IO

### What is it? ü§î
Non-blocking IO (Input/Output) is a programming paradigm where a thread doesn't have to wait for an I/O operation to complete before moving on. In other words, if a thread requests to read or write data from/to a source and the data isn't immediately available, the thread can continue with other tasks instead of being blocked.

### Why is it used? üõ†Ô∏è
Non-blocking IO is used to optimize resource utilization and enhance application responsiveness. It's particularly useful in high-concurrency environments where threads need to manage multiple tasks concurrently without being held up by I/O operations.

### When to use it? ‚è∞
Non-blocking IO is ideal for applications that require high concurrency and responsiveness, such as web servers, real-time systems, and event-driven applications. It's typically used when scalability and performance are key requirements.

### Why is it good to use? üëç
- **Scalability**: Non-blocking IO allows for efficient handling of a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Resource utilization**: It maximizes resource utilization by enabling threads to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations.
- **Responsiveness**: Non-blocking IO improves application responsiveness by avoiding thread blocking and reducing latency.

### Advantages:
1. **Scalability**: Non-blocking IO can handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.
2. **Resource efficiency**: It maximizes resource utilization by allowing threads to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations.
3. **Responsiveness**: Non-blocking IO improves application responsiveness by minimizing latency.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Complexity**: Non-blocking IO is more complex to implement and understand compared to blocking IO.
2. **Concurrency management**: It requires careful management of concurrency issues such as race conditions and synchronization.
3. **Callback hell**: In event-driven architectures, managing nested callbacks can lead to code that's difficult to read and maintain.

### Example Implementation in Java:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousFileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;

public class NonBlockingIOExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            AsynchronousFileChannel fileChannel = AsynchronousFileChannel.open(
                    Paths.get("example.txt"), StandardOpenOption.READ);

            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

            fileChannel.read(buffer, 0, null, new CompletionHandler<Integer, Void>() {
                @Override
                public void completed(Integer result, Void attachment) {
                    buffer.flip();
                    byte[] data = new byte[buffer.limit()];
                    buffer.get(data);
                    System.out.println(new String(data));
                    buffer.clear();
                }

                @Override
                public void failed(Throwable exc, Void attachment) {
                    System.out.println("Error: " + exc.getMessage());
                }
            });

            // Continue with other tasks while the read operation is in progress

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Analogy to Understand:
Think of non-blocking IO like a buffet restaurant. Instead of waiting for a specific dish to be prepared, you can move on to the next station and serve yourself whatever is available. Similarly, in non-blocking IO, threads continue executing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete, maximizing efficiency and throughput.
